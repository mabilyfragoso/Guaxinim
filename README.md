### Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to apply the knowledge and steps involved in **system analysis, design, and prototyping** learned in class. The website simulates the online presence of an auto parts store, "Guaxinim - Auto Parts," aiming to demonstrate information organization and the structure of a system for retail automotive products.

### Key Features

Although this is a prototype for academic purposes, the website includes the following sections and functionalities:

* **Product Catalog:** Displays a variety of auto parts such as motor oil, shock absorbers, tires, and accessories, simulating a product inventory.
* **Company Information:** Details about the history, mission, and values of Guaxinim - Auto Parts.
* **Franchise Locations:** Lists the different store units in Cear√°, Brazil, including addresses and operating hours.
* **Contact/Customer Service Sections:** Areas where users can supposedly find information or get in touch.

### Technologies Used

The project was developed using standard web technologies, focusing on presentation and structure:

* **HTML:** For structuring content and semantic markup.
* **CSS:** For styling and visual design, ensuring an intuitive and appealing interface.
* **JavaScript:** For basic interactivity elements.

### Applied Systems Analysis and Design Concepts

During the development of this project, several course concepts were applied, including:

* **Requirements Gathering:** Simulating the identification of system needs for an auto parts store.
* **Conceptual Data Modeling:** Although there isn't a real database, the structure of product, store, and contact information reflects planning for how this data would be organized.
* **User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Design:** Focus on creating a user-friendly interface and a clear user experience for navigating the catalog and accessing store information.
* **Information Architecture:** Logical organization of content to facilitate finding products and store details.
* **Prototyping:** Building a functional prototype to visualize the system before potential full implementation.
